It has:\n\nfour seasons\nbagpipes\ndelightful students\n\nCheck it out for yourself:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Exercise 1: Deduce Quarto features\nCheck out the appearance and contents of this document. Thoughts?\nIn the toolbar at the top of this document, Render the .qmd file into a .html file. Where is this file stored? Thoughts about its appearance / contents? Can you edit it?\nToggling between the .qmd and .html files, explain the purpose of the following features in the .qmd file:\n*\n**\n#\n-\n\\\n![](url)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Exercise 2: Code\nHow does this appear in the .qmd? The .html? So…?!\nseq(from = 100, to = 1000, by = 50)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 Exercise 3: Chunks\nQuarto isn’t a mind reader – we must distinguish R code from text. We do so by putting code inside an R chunk:\n\nseq(from = 100, to = 1000, by = 50)\n\n [1]  100  150  200  250  300  350  400  450  500  550  600  650  700  750  800\n[16]  850  900  950 1000\n\n\n\nPut the seq() code in the chunk.\nPress the green arrow in the top right of the chunk. What happens in the qmd?\nRender. What appears in the html: R code, output, or both?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 Exercise 4: Practice\n\nUse R code to create the following sequence: 10 10 10 10\nStore the sequence as four_tens.\nUse an R function (which we haven’t learned!) to add up the numbers in four_tens.\n\n\n(four_tens &lt;- rep(x = 10, times = 4))\n\n[1] 10 10 10 10\n\nsum(four_tens)\n\n[1] 40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 Exercise 5: Fix this code\nCode is a form of communication, and the code below doesn’t cut it.\nPut the code in a chunk and fix it.\n\nrep(x = 1, times = 10)\n\n [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nseq(from = 100, to = 1000, length = 20)\n\n [1]  100.0000  147.3684  194.7368  242.1053  289.4737  336.8421  384.2105\n [8]  431.5789  478.9474  526.3158  573.6842  621.0526  668.4211  715.7895\n[15]  763.1579  810.5263  857.8947  905.2632  952.6316 1000.0000\n\n(theNumberOfStudents &lt;- 27)\n\n[1] 27",
